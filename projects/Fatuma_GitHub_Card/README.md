#Fatuma_Github_Card

My card is a simple PCB that has my name, cute flower design and github handel.

CAD $17.80

I never made a PCB before. Making the schematics was very challenging because it was my first time doing that. I just never did electronics before and I relied heavily
on tutorials and just ignoring the errors. Maybe I will make more.
